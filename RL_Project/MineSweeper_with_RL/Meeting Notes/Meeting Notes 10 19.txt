Meeting Notes 10.19.21

Experiment:
Run two networks with a complex network vs simpler network to see training plateau

Network Comparisons:
	One dense layer size 2500 no dropout
	One dense layer size 2500 dropout
	One dense 2500 with l2 reg

	One dense layer size 1250 no dropout
	One dense layer size 1250 dropout
	One dense 1250 with l2 reg

	2 dense layers size 600 nodes, no dropout
	2 dense layers size 600 dropout
	2 dense 600, reg

Batch normalization layers?



Doubleq and actor critic back running

Use predicitve network to generate state action pairs to train q network
