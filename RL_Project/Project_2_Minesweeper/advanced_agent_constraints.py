Advanced Agent using Basic Logic and Constraint Satisfaction:
1) Create frequency table for all spots in the hidden neighbors list
2) Select the square which appears the most
3) Prepare two copies of the KB, KM, and KS lists
4)
    a) Add this square to the known mines list
    b) Update the KB with this assumption, and see if any facts produce additional changes to the KS/KM lists
5)
    a) Add this square to the known safe list
    b) Update the KB with this assumption, and see if any facts produce additional changes to the KS/KM lists
6) Compare any KS/KM additions beside the step2 additions
    6a) If any square shows up on both KM/KS, then update the original KB/KS/KM lists
